# imu motion tracking
orientation: set at start, tracked by integrating gyro, corrected by magnetometer (north) and accelerometer (earths gravity down)
acceleration: measured directly
velocity: integrate acceleration, detect standstill (application specific)
position: integrate velocity+acceleration

note: acceleration is in local (intrinsic) direction, usually it makes sense to transform it to global (extrinsic coordinates for tracking

## data preparation
- remove outliners
- filter noise

## gyro
*measures orientation change in Â°/s
*short term: reliable; long term: drift
calibration: correct bias (counteract drift)

## acceleration
*measures linear acceleration in m/s^2
*short term: noisy; long term: reliable at detecting earths gravity
calibration: scale output againsts 1g earth gravity at rest

## magnetic
*measures direction of magnetic field
*short term: noisy; long term: reliable orientation correction
=> orientation correction on long time scales
calibration: correct deformation and offset (by internal structure and internal magnetic field) of magnetic field vector when rotating device



## pressure
=> height

## temperature
=>drift calibration/compensation
