# performance metrics

### distance,steps,time
- km, time(s), pace (min/km)
- steps (stp), cadence (steps/min)
- stride length (m), contact/stance time (ms), flight time (ms), contact ratio (%),

### forces
- peak vertical ground reaction force (F)
- braking(g; slow down before foot strike), impact(g; foot strike impact), cummulative shock(g)

### posture
- shoe ride/prints
- footstrike type
- pronation (range of angle from foot strike to lift off perpendiculat to direction of travel)
- max pronation velocity (°/s)
- pronation excursion (°,range of angle from foot strike to lift off in direction of travel; actually two values: from foot strike to maximum pronation (FS>MP) and from maximum pronation to toe off (FS>TO))
- stance velocity (velocity of pronation excursion)
- stride angle (%)
- pelvis tilt/obliquity/rotation (°) and their velocities

### combined
- power (~W)
- symmetry (symmetry of efficiency, shock, motion)
- efficiency (shorter contact time, longer flight time, higher step rate)
- motion (Foot Strike and Pronation)
